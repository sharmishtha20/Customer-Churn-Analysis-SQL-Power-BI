# Customer-Churn-Analysis-SQL-Power-BI
This end-to-end Business Intelligence project demonstrates my ability to extract meaningful insights from raw data using SQL and communicate them effectively through dynamic visualizations in Power BI. The analysis is focused on customer churn behavior, aiming to identify risk segments and enable data-driven retention strategies.

ðŸ’¼ Why This Project Matters
Understanding why customers leave is critical for any subscription-based business. I approached this problem like a Product/Data Analystâ€”identifying key business questions, preparing the data pipeline, and building an executive-friendly dashboard that empowers stakeholders to act.

ðŸ”¨ Tools & Technologies:
SQL: Data cleaning, joins, feature engineering, aggregations

Power BI: Interactive report design, DAX formulas, storytelling with visuals

âœ… My Role & Contributions:
Data Preparation: Wrote optimized SQL scripts to join multiple tables (customer details, service usage, churn flags), cleaned inconsistencies, and created calculated features like tenure brackets and revenue segments.

Business Insight Development: Identified patterns linking churn with contract type, internet service, payment method, and monthly charges.

Dashboard Design: Built a Power BI report tailored for both business users and technical stakeholders, with filters, KPIs, trend lines, and drill-throughs.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Outcomes:
Revealed that month-to-month customers are ~3x more likely to churn

Identified high-churn clusters: fiber users on electronic payment plans with low tenure

Delivered a reusable dashboard that can be scaled for other retention use cases

ðŸš€ Skills Demonstrated:
Data wrangling & transformation (SQL)

Business insight generation

Dashboard design for real-world decisions

Stakeholder-focused storytelling

ðŸ“Œ This project reflects my mindset as a data analyst: solving real problems with clean data, critical thinking, and visual clarity.
